# OE UI v3.n (newblue)

This repository allows for the development of new OpenEyes UI (OE v3.n) separately from the core OpenEyes project.

OE UI v3.0 CSS has been developed to completely replace all existing previous CSS. It aims to minimise and clean-up existing UI elements (DOM) to provide a more consistent UI approach (feel) for users throughout OpenEyes UI experience. It incorporates many UX improvements to data presentation and entry. 

## Approach concept

* Create a modern UI that is clean, fast and easy to use. 
* Avoid vertical scrolling as much as possible (clincial requirement)
* Avoid verbose naming and keep things succinct. e.g. for drop downs use 'Select', not: '- Please Select -'. 
* Medical data must be presented in clean and efficient way

## Icons

* Event icons must be 76px x 76px, and must be named correctly. 
* Eyedraw icon (doodles) must be 32px x 32px, and must be named correctly.
* Gulp is used to create the PNG sprite sheets and scss positioning for icons.
* SVGs are used in a few diffent ways, see source.
