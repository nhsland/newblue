# OE UI v3.n (newblue)

This repository allows the development of new UI (OE v3.n) pieces separately from the core OpenEyes project.

OE UI v3.0 CSS has been developed to replace all existing CSS. It attempts to minimise and clean the existing UI elements (CSS & DOM) to provide a more consistent UI approach (feel) for users throughout all of OpenEyes UI. It incorporates many improvements to data presentation and entry. 

## UI approach

* Clean, fast and easy to digest all presented data. 
* Avoid vertical scrolling where possible.
* Avoid verbose naming and keep things succinct. e.g. for drop downs don't use '- Please Select -', use 'Select'. 
* Same applies to labels.


## Icons

* Event icons must be 76px x 76px, and must be named correctly. 
* Eyedraw icon (doodles) must be 32px x 32px, and must be named correctly.
* Gulp creates the PNG sprite sheets and scss positioning.
* SVGs are used in 2 ways, as a Sprite Sheet and as background-images in css
